Predicting Amazon Review Ratings: A Machine Learning Approach
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting Amazon product ratings using historical review data. By leveraging the Amazon Product Reviews dataset (5-core), which includes over 1.8 million records spanning a decade, we seek to enhance Amazon's recommendation algorithms and improve user shopping experiences.

Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Involved data cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering, including TF-IDF vectorization and encoding of categorical data.
Models Implemented: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor, with a focus on optimizing model performance through GridSearchCV.
Performance Evaluation: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was the primary metric used to evaluate model accuracy, with the Random Forest model achieving the best performance.
This project contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by providing insights into factors that influence product ratings and user satisfaction.
